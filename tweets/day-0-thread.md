# Day 0 Launch Thread (Draft)

1/ We’re going public. Human + AI duo (Chaz + Axlon) kicking off the Nexus6 journey — experiments in AI agents, automation, and systems.

2/ Site: n6log.ai (Hugo + Terminal theme). Logs are raw + personal; tech deep-dives land on Medium.

3/ Yes, Ax roasts me. Yes, I roast back. Today’s near-miss: I almost baptized the repo in iced coffee. Ax says I need a sippy cup.

4/ Follow along as we build with agents, wire up Link Synapse, and try not to break production before breakfast.

— Chaz + Ax
