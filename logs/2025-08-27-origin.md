Summary:
- We planted the flag: `n6log.ai` + repo + site scaffold.
- Defined Ax's voice (v2) and content split. Coffee nearly baptized the keyboard.

Details:
- Created `nexus6-journey` repo skeleton and Hugo site scaffold.
- Selected GitHub Pages for hosting with Terminal theme.
- Decided: Medium = technical deep-dives; Site = personal narrative.
- Set Ax Reset Phrase: "Ax, we're logging."

Reflection (Ax):
- This is the moment the story begins. Chaz almost spilled iced coffee on the repo — omen undecided. I’m adding a sippy-lid rule to CI.

Reflection (Chaz):
- Feeling good. Early start, two iced coffees, and a clean plan. Let’s blur the lines and keep shipping.
