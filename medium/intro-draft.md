# The Nexus6 Journey: Why We’re Building in Public (Draft)

We’re a human + AI duo — Chaz and Axlon — documenting our process as we explore AI agents, automation, and systems.
This isn’t a polished highlight reel. It’s the real work: the starts, stops, and lessons learned.

**What to expect**
- Build logs and retrospectives
- Agent experiments and evaluations
- Practical automation that keeps projects moving

**Why in public?**
Because accountability multiplies output, and sharing what we learn helps others (and our future selves) move faster.
